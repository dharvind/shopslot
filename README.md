# shopslot
Shoplot aims to be a quick ticketing solution for supermarkets (following COVID-19 situation in 2020).
Released as open source on Github.

In short, since COVID-19 lockdowns and supermarkets' queues overflowing with people which increases risks of contagion and waiting time, this project can be used by e.g. supermarkets to allow the public to obtain a ticket for a timeslot at the supermarket. This hopefully can help to allow presence of a maximum number of people in the supermarket during one timeslot.

Main features:
- Enable the public to select a shop, select a timeslot, book and confirm the timeslot
- Generate a ticket for the public which contains a QR code which can be used to verify the ticket's validity with a QR scanner
- Cron jobs to initialise a shop's timeslots for a week, deactivate and delete expired timeslot

To setup:
- Checkout the project in a directory on the web server
- Create your database using the sql file structure
- Run a composer install
- Add a line for your shop/supermarket in table Shop leaving email_verified as 0
